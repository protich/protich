### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Peter Rotich - I am a [serial hustler](https://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/education/2017/04/20/meet-local-tech-entrepreneur-who-never-used-computer-until-college/100566224/); software engineer, founder ([Enhancesoft](https://enhancesoft.com)), open source developer ([osTicket](https://gothub.com/osTicket/)).

I am Founder and Chief Executive Officer at [Enhancesoft](https://enhancesoft.com), a software company based in Alexandria, Louisiana (now fully remote). I founded Enhancesoft with a mission of creating simple yet elegant tools to get customer support out of a shared email inbox and off post-it notes. Our products include [osTicket](https://osticket.com) and [SupportSystem](https://supportsystem.com).

âš¡ Fun fact: I was born and raised in rural Kenya and grew up in a small village with no electricity or running water! I did not use a computer until college.
