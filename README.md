### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Peter Rotich - I'm a serial hustler, software engineer, founder (Enhancesoft), open source developer (osTicket).

I am Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Enhancesoft, a software company based in Alexandria, Louisiana (now fully remote). I founded Enhancesoft with a mission of creating simple yet elegant tools to get customer support out of a shared email inbox and off post-it notes. Our products include osTicket and SupportSystem.

âš¡ Fun fact: I was born and raised in rural Kenya and grew up in a small village with no electricity or running water! Didn't use a computer until college.
